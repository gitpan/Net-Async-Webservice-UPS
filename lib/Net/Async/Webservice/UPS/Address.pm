=head1 NAME

Net::Async::Webservice::UPS::Address - an address for UPS

=head1 VERSION

version 1.0.3

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<city>

String with the name of the city, optional.

=head2 C<postal_code>

String with the post code of the address, required.

=head2 C<postal_code_extended>

String with the extended post code of the address, optional. If a
postcode matching C<< \d+-\d+ >> is passed in to the constructor, the
first group of digits is assigned to L</postal_code> and the second
one to L</postal_code_extended>.

=head2 C<state>

String with the name of the state, optional.

=head2 C<country_code>

String with the 2 letter country code, optional (defaults to C<US>).

=head2 C<name>

String with the recipient name, optional.

=head2 C<building_name>

String with the building name, optional.

=head2 C<address>

String with the first line of the address, optional.

=head2 C<address2>

String with the second line of address, optional.

=head2 C<address3>

String with the third line of the address, optional.

=head2 C<is_residential>

Boolean, indicating whether this address is residential. Optional.

=head2 C<quality>

This should only be set in objects that are returned as part of a
L<Net::Async::Webservice::UPS::Response::Address>. It's a float
between 0 and 1 expressing how good a match this address is for the
one provided.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<is_exact_match>

True if L</quality> is 1. This method exists for compatibility with
L<Net::UPS::Address>.

=head2 C<is_very_close_match>

True if L</quality> is >= 0.95. This method exists for compatibility
with L<Net::UPS::Address>.

=head2 C<is_close_match>

True if L</quality> is >=0.9. This method exists for compatibility
with L<Net::UPS::Address>.

=head2 C<is_possible_match>

True if L</quality> is >= 0.9 (yes, the same as
L</is_close_match>). This method exists for compatibility with
L<Net::UPS::Address>.

=head2 C<is_poor_match>

True if L</quality> is <= 0.69. This method exists for compatibility
with L<Net::UPS::Address>.

=head2 C<as_hash>

Returns a hashref that, when passed through L<XML::Simple>, will
produce the XML fragment needed in UPS requests to represent this
address. Takes one parameter, either C<'AV'> or C<'XAV'>, to select
which representation to use (C<'XAV'> is the "street level validation"
variant).

=head2 C<cache_id>

Returns a string identifying this address.
