Net::Async::Webservice::UPS::Rate - shipment rate from UPS

=head1 VERSION

version 1.1.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects of this class are usually only seen inside
L<Net::Async::Webservice::UPS::Response::Rate>, as returned by
L<Net::Async::Webservice::UPS/request_rate>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<unit>

Either C<KGS> or C<LBS>, unit for the L</billing_weight>.

=head2 C<billing_weight>

The weight that was used to generate the price, not necessarily the
actual weight of the shipment or package.

=head2 C<total_charges_currency>

Currency code for the L</total_charges>.

=head2 C<total_charges>

Total rated cost of the shipment.

=head2 C<rated_package>

The package that was used to provide this rate.

=head2 C<service>

I<Weak> reference to the L<Net::Async::Webservice::UPS::Service> this
rate is for. It's weak because the service holds references to rates,
and we really don't want cycles.

=head2 C<from>

Sender address for this shipment.

=head2 C<to>

Recipient address for this shipment.
