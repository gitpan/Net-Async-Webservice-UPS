1.0.5     2014-09-08 16:09:04+01:00 Europe/London
 - the ::Response::PackageResult objects in a
   ::Response::ShipmentAccept now link back to the ::Package objects
   they relate to
 - ::Package now has separate linear_unit and weight_unit attributes;
   measurement_system is now a shortcut in the constructor
   parameters. Note that using kilograms/inches or pounds/centimetres
   will currently result in an error message from UPS
 - the 'id' attribute of ::Package is now a string; it's no longer
   used internally, so it's now a generic user-side identifier

1.0.4     2014-09-02 09:54:21+01:00 Europe/London
 - bump requirement of Types::Standard to get fix for RT #98362; it
